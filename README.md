# Wordle Clone (Old)  

![wordle showcase](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3636777-a7e3-4aef-97a9-7222d9501d6d)  

This **Wordle Clone** was my first real dive into **React** and front-end development. While the code is bloated and unoptimized (as I was still learning!), it’s a great snapshot of my early journey into **component-based UI design** and **state management**.  

The game follows the same mechanics as Wordle: guess a **5-letter word** in **6 tries**, with color-coded feedback indicating correct letters and positions.

## ✨ What I Built  
- **React Components**: Broke the UI into reusable components to manage different parts of the game.  
- **State Management**: Used `useState` to track guesses and game logic.  
- **Color-Coded Feedback**:  
  - 🟩 **Green**: Correct letter, correct position.  
  - 🟨 **Yellow**: Correct letter, wrong position.  
  - ⬜ **Gray**: Incorrect letter.  
- **Basic Game Logic**: Implemented a word-checking system to compare guesses with the correct answer.  
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured the game works on both **desktop and mobile** devices.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Skills Learned  
- **React** – First hands-on experience with **components**, **props**, and **state management**.  
- **JSX** – Writing HTML-like structures within JavaScript.  
- **CSS** – Creating a simple, clean layout inspired by the original Wordle.  
- **Game Logic Implementation** – Managing user input, validation, and visual feedback.

## 🔄 Looking Back  
This project was my **first step into React**, and it taught me a lot about **thinking in components** and **handling UI updates efficiently**. If I were to rebuild it today, I’d:  
- Optimize state management for better performance.  
- Use **React Context or Redux** for handling global state more effectively.  
- Improve the UI and animations for a smoother experience.
