# Wordle Clone (Old)  

**Wordle Clone** is a simple version of the popular word-guessing game built with **React** for the first time. This was my first real dive into React, and although the code is bloated and messy (as I was still learning!), it’s a good snapshot of my early journey into web development.

The game follows the same mechanics as Wordle: you must guess a 5-letter word in 6 tries, with feedback after each guess that tells you which letters are correct or in the wrong position.

## 🎮 Play the Game  
You can try the game [here!](https://sereneprince.github.io/Wordle-Clone/)

## ✨ Features  
- **Color-Coded Feedback**:  
   - 🟩 **Green**: Correct letter, correct position.  
   - 🟨 **Yellow**: Correct letter, wrong position.  
   - ⬜ **Gray**: Incorrect letter.  
- **Multiple Tries**: You get 6 attempts to guess the word.  
- **Responsive Design**: The game is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.  
- **Game Reset**: Refresh the page to get a new word and start again.  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **React**: My first experience using React, focusing on components and state management.  
- **JSX**: Integrated HTML-like syntax within JavaScript for UI components.  
- **CSS**: Styled the game with a simple, clean layout inspired by the original Wordle.  
- **Node.js (with npm)**: Managed dependencies and built the project.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated  
- **Learning React**: Gained experience with **components**, **state management**, and **hooks** (like `useState` and `useEffect`).  
- **Understanding Game Logic**: Implemented logic to handle guesses, feedback, and attempts.  
- **CSS Layouts**: Designed the game interface to mimic the Wordle aesthetic.  
- **Development Setup**: Used **npm** and **Vite** for setting up the project and building it.

### **Note on the "Old" Version**  
This is the **old** version of the Wordle clone. It was a fun experiment with React and helped me learn a lot. Since then, I’ve improved my React skills, and I now have a new and cleaner version of the project available in another repository on my GitHub. Check out the updated version if you’re interested in seeing my progress!
